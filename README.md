# Stormworks_Delaunay-Triangulation

Current plan is to try implement 3d triangulation in game of Stormworks: Build and Rescue, in which current idea is roughly to use k-d tree and figure out a 3d triangulation algorithm. Then figure out spherical bounding volume hierarchy to spatially partition the triangle mesh, but also try to implement a LOD (level of detail) in the leaf nodes, somehow. It is just an idea right now and it should be able to fit in 3 LUA scripts in game.
